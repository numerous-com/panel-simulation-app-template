# Simulation Application User Guide

## Overview
This application allows you to run simulations with customizable parameters and monitor their progress in real-time.

## Getting Started

### Interface Components

The application interface consists of several elements:
- Two numerical input fields (Input 1 and Input 2)
- Duration field
- Start and Stop buttons
- Progress bar
- Results display area

## Running a Simulation

### 1. Setting Parameters
- **Input 1**: Enter a value between 0.1 and 10.0
- **Input 2**: Enter a value between 0.1 and 10.0
- **Duration**: Specify how long the simulation should run (1-100 seconds)

### 2. Starting the Simulation
1. After setting your desired parameters, click the black "Start" button
2. The progress bar will begin to fill, showing the simulation's progress
3. Wait for the simulation to complete

### 3. Monitoring Progress
- Watch the progress bar to see the simulation's completion percentage
- The simulation will run for the duration you specified

### 4. Viewing Results
- Once complete, the results will appear below the progress bar
- If successful, you'll see "Result: [value]"
- If there's an error, an error message will be displayed

### 5. Stopping a Simulation
- To stop a running simulation, click the red "Stop" button
- You'll see the message "Simulation stopped"
- You can start a new simulation after stopping the current one
